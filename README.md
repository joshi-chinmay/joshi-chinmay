ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I am Chinmay Joshi, and Iâ€™m a User Experience Designer with a background in tech.

ðŸŒŽ My everyday job is a combination of problem-solving and creative thinking.

ðŸ§  I believe the key to a successful user experience is an amalgamation of empathy, problem-solving, creativity, and constrained innovation.

ðŸŒ‡ Apart from design, I love to talk about tech, positivity, food, zero-waste lifestyle, music, and Formula 1.
